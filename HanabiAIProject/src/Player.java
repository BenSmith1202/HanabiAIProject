		/*-=|CARD MARKERS|=-
    There are four card markers:
    -  UNKNOWN cards are cards which have NOT been hinted at yet.
    -  The leftmost UNKNOWN card is the CHOP card
    -  if the CHOP card is hinted at (even if hinted at as part of a multi hint) is becomes SAVED
    -  if a SAVED or UNKNOWN card is hinted at (by itself) it is IMMEDIATELY_PLAYABLE.
      IMMEDIATELY_PLAYABLE cards are valid to play onto the stacks right now.

    Additionally, if there is only one card of a certain type left in play (out of the discard pile), and
     it has not been played yet, it is ENDANGERED.

    -=|STRATEGY|=-
    Flow of play:

    If you see any ENDANGERED cards on another player's CHOP position ->
      Hint at it with the fewest collateral cards possible (hint as few cards other than the chop as you can)
    Else:
    If you have a card marked IMMEDIATELY_PLAYABLE ->
      play it!
    Else:
    If another player has a card that they should mark IMMEDIATELY_PLAYABLE ->
      If you can hint at that card alone (no collateral) ->
        Hint at the card
    Else:
    If you have an unknown card in the CHOP position ->
      Discard the card in your Chop position.
    Else:
    Chop your oldest saved card
